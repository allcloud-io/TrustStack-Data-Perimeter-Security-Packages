# TrustStack: Enabling Sensitive Workloads in the Public Cloud with Prevention-First Security and Builder Agility

TrustStack is a prevention-first cybersecurity framework that enables highly regulated organizations, government agencies, and defense units to securely run sensitive workloads in AWS commercial regions. Visit [TrustStack's documentation](https://github.com/allcloud-io/TrustStack) for more information.

This project implements the Data Perimeter Accelerator component of the TrustStack framework. The Data Perimeter Accelerator generates security configurations which you can easily deploy using the AWS Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA). Reference the [How it works?](#how-it-works) section for more details.

## About TrustStack

### Data Perimeter Guidelines

The [Data Perimeter Guidelines](docs/data-perimeter-guidelines.md) document provides comprehensive guidance on implementing data perimeter controls in AWS environments to establish clear boundaries that protect your AWS resources and data. The security packages offered by TrustStack comply with these guidelines.

### Security Packages Offered By TrustStack

TrustStack offers a comprehensive set of security packages that protect sensitive workloads while maintaining developer agility. Each security package addresses specific security concerns. Refer to [TrustStack Security Packages](apps/security-packages/README.md) for detailed information about the security controls offered by TrustStack.

## How it works?

At its core, TrustStack's Data Perimeter Accelerator is a configuration engine for AWS Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA). The framework generates LZA-compatible security configurations that can be seamlessly integrated into your existing AWS multi-account environment.

**Deployment Architecture:**

We recommend deploying the TrustStack framework in the same account as your Landing Zone Accelerator deployment to ensure optimal integration and management.

**Configuration Generation Process:**

1. **Asset Generation**: When you deploy the TrustStack framework, an Amazon S3 bucket is automatically created in your AWS account. This bucket serves as the output location for all Landing Zone Accelerator-compatible assets generated by the TrustStack framework.

2. **Security Package Selection**: You can choose from TrustStack's comprehensive suite of security packages based on your organization's specific requirements and compliance needs.

3. **Download and Deploy**: The generated security configurations can be downloaded from the S3 bucket and integrated into your Landing Zone Accelerator deployment, enabling you to deploy your chosen security packages across your AWS organization.

This approach ensures that TrustStack's prevention-first security controls are consistently applied across all accounts and workloads in your AWS environment while maintaining compatibility with your existing LZA infrastructure.

## User Guide

The [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md) provides a step-by-step guide on how to deploy the TrustStack framework in your AWS organization.

## Local Development Guide

The [Local Development Guide](docs/local-development-guide.md) provides detailed instructions for setting up your local development environment.
