# TrustStack's Data Perimeter Accelerator

TrustStack is a prevention-first cybersecurity framework that enables highly regulated organizations, government agencies, and defense units to securely run sensitive workloads in AWS commercial regions. Visit [TrustStack's documentation](https://github.com/allcloud-io/TrustStack) for more information.

This project implements service-specific guidance as part of the TrustStack framework. The service-specific guidance generates security configurations that can be easily deployed using the AWS Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA). For more details, reference the [How it works?](#how-it-works) section.

## About this project

### Data Perimeter Guidelines

The [Data Perimeter Guidelines](docs/data-perimeter-guidelines.md) document provides general guidance on implementing data perimeter controls in AWS environments to establish clear boundaries that protect your AWS resources and data. The security packages offered by TrustStack implement service-specific considerations that complement these general guidelines.

**Important Note**: TrustStack currently focuses on service-specific considerations and controls. It does not include foundational/default data perimeter policies. Organizations should implement comprehensive data perimeter controls by combining TrustStack's service-specific guidance with foundational data perimeter policies based on their specific requirements.

### Security Packages Offered By TrustStack's Service-Specific Guidance

TrustStack offers a set of security packages that address specific-service security concerns while maintaining developer agility. Each security package addresses service-specific considerations for data perimeter implementation. Refer to [TrustStack Security Packages](apps/security-packages/README.md) for detailed information about the service-specific security controls offered by TrustStack.

## How it works?

At its core, TrustStack's Data Perimeter Accelerator is a configuration engine for AWS Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA). The framework generates LZA-compatible security configurations that can be seamlessly integrated into your existing AWS multi-account environment.

**Deployment Architecture:**

We recommend deploying the TrustStack framework in the same account as your Landing Zone Accelerator deployment to ensure optimal integration and management.

**Configuration Generation Process:**

1. **Asset Generation**: When you deploy the TrustStack framework, an Amazon S3 bucket is automatically created in your AWS account. This bucket serves as the output location for all Landing Zone Accelerator-compatible assets generated by the TrustStack framework.

2. **Security Package Selection**: You can choose from TrustStack's suite of service-specific security packages based on your organization's specific requirements and compliance needs.

3. **Download and Deploy**: The generated security configurations can be downloaded from the S3 bucket and integrated into your Landing Zone Accelerator deployment, enabling you to deploy your chosen security packages across your AWS organization.

This approach ensures that TrustStack's prevention-first security controls are consistently applied across all accounts and workloads in your AWS environment while maintaining compatibility with your existing LZA infrastructure.
